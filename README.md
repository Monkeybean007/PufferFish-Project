# PufferFish Project
Added Pufferfish Model into my Repo. The big struggle that I had with this project was getting the shapes how I wanted them as I am not very good at Zbrush so I did most in Maya with some minor changes in Zbrush to fine tune it. I took some reference from Mario Bros but came up with most of it on my own accord.
