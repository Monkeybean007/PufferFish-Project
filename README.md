# PufferFish Project
Added Pufferfish Model into my Repo. The big struggle that I had with this project was getting the shapes how I wanted them as I am not very good at Zbrush so I did most in Maya with some minor changes in Zbrush to fine tune it. I took some reference from Mario Bros but came up with most of it on my own accord. 
Surfaced and UV Wrapped the fish. I had some issues with the UV Wrapping as the wraps did not want to layout correctly and would then cause issues in Substance. Had to really take my time and line up everything/ stitch seams, etc. The surfacing
part was easier other than deciding what theme to go with.
